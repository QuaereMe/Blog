My name is Christopher Bartz. 

I hope that this site will be helpful for you. I want it to be a tool for starting quality conversations, and continuing them, too. Think of it as an open letter, and don’t hesitate to write your own! Then, seek me, [quāere me](https://twitter.com/QuaereMe).

## About Myself
I work at Google NYC in advertising, engineering custom solutions for the business needs of large advertising agencies. Basically this means solving the same categories of problems that smaller companies have, but with unique challenges that only occur on a larger scale.

I have an MBA from Benedictine College, and previously was an Associate Senior Software Engineer at Cerner in KC, writing medical record business logic. I have a B.A. in Computer Science cum laude, and was a librarian for four years. For three semesters, I directed a volunteer choir in renaissance polyphony and Gregorian chant. I also studied the trivium and quadrivium as part of the liberal arts in college, and I enjoy attending Latin-speaking conferences.
